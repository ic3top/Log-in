## General info
Here is a simple realization of login/registration forms with ajax requests. So you can create new user using registration form, this user with all his/her data will be saved on server (as a Heroku) with POST method (if no errors occured). Than you can try log-in into this user, that you have created recently. You will be notified with toast-messages (on the left-top corner) about errors or success.
